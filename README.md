Insights and Trends: a quick analysis of the data revealed a few insights and some information that will be shared with the corresponding NHS trusts. The different systems and ways of recording come into sharp focus with the analysis. 
It can be seen that the top 4 NHS trusts where most amount of time recorded were in the East and South-East of England. London could only manage only 1 trust. A significant number of appointments were not attended by patients, and many were classified as unknown which means that it is not known whether the patient attended or not and that can impact complete analysis leading to wrong conclusions. 
Many records are classified as unmapped which means not recorded properly. This will affect the data analysis and not be able to give the correct information required for decision-making. They were also classified as inconsistent mapping which meant that the data was not recorded under the current classification system and shows that the data classification must be revised, to capture all data under the relevant classification.
 More analysis is to be done to find how NHS can action the pinch points and create a standard way of recording and managing data.

Week 3 Summary: After making sure that the data files have been imported correnbtly in Pandas and have been set up corrently for analysis by sense checking using functions like .dtypes(), .info() and columns(), I then procedded to answer the questions by using functions like .value_counts() which returns the count of occurrences of a particualr data, .sum() to calculate totals. I also used the locator function .loc() to extract the columns needed for analysis. I used functions to do analysis on dates which was quite new to me and a bit daunting. To convert the date type to datetime() function was new to me and it introduce me to a whole new way of analysing date related columns. I learnt how to use groupby() function to split columns and sort them and extract specific date from other columns. It was quite interesting and would like to know more about how to use these syntaxes more better. As I understand practices is of course the best way.
