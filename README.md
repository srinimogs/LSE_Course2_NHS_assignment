Insights and Trends: a quick analysis of the data revealed a few insights and some information that will be shared with the corresponding NHS trusts. The different systems and ways of recording come into sharp focus with the analysis. 
It can be seen that the top 4 NHS trusts where most amount of time recorded were in the East and South-East of England. London could only manage only 1 trust. A significant number of appointments were not attended by patients, and many were classified as unknown which means that it is not known whether the patient attended or not and that can impact complete analysis leading to wrong conclusions. 
Many records are classified as unmapped which means not recorded properly. This will affect the data analysis and not be able to give the correct information required for decision-making. They were also classified as inconsistent mapping which meant that the data was not recorded under the current classification system and shows that the data classification must be revised, to capture all data under the relevant classification.
 More analysis is to be done to find how NHS can action the pinch points and create a standard way of recording and managing data.
